# MrCMS

**Mr CMS is an ASP.NET MVC 5 C# open source content management system and framework.**

**For more information please visit [www.mrcms.com](https://www.mrcms.com)**

Designed from the ground up, Mr CMS is extremely easy for both developers and content editors.

For content editors, the CMS is designed in a way that they do not need to know any HTML knowledge.

For developers, the framework allows you to create unlimited amounts of different page types, widgets and layouts. All which content editors can then administer through a simple admin interface, or through in line editing.

Developers are not limited by what they can build within Mr CMS. Mr CMS has the concept of 'Apps' which contain functionality. I.E you could write a Blog app, an eCommerce app and so forth. In other words, whilst you can have a eCommerce plugin to Wordpress, its not very scalable and not its intended purpose. Mr CMS is whatever you build it to be.

Within apps you have page types, widget types and of course logic which makes your bespoke features work.

A getting started guide will be published soon on how to start building your own apps.
